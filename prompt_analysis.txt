Prompt Analysis Results
=====================

Prompt: which team performed better?

Principle: Context
Verdict: Weak
Explanation: The prompt lacks sufficient background information, a clear context, defined goals, and an explanation of the setting or environment.
Suggestion: Provide more details such as the teams being compared, the criteria for performance evaluation, the context of their performance, and any relevant setting or environment information to improve clarity and enable a meaningful analysis.
--------------------------------------------------

Principle: MachineTreatment
Verdict: Weak
Explanation: The prompt does not treat the LLM appropriately as a machine. It lacks specific guidance or criteria for evaluating performance, which is essential for a machine to provide a meaningful response.
Suggestion: Provide specific performance metrics or criteria for evaluating team performance to guide the LLM's analysis effectively.
--------------------------------------------------

Principle: Constraints
Verdict: Weak
Explanation: The prompt lacks clear boundaries, specific requirements, or numerical constraints. It is quite vague and open-ended.
Suggestion: To improve, specify the criteria or metrics for evaluating team performance, provide context or background information, and define what 'performing better' means in this context.
--------------------------------------------------

Principle: Format
Verdict: Weak
Explanation: The prompt lacks clear specifications for input and output format. It does not mention any specific formatting requirements such as JSON, XML, or any structural requirements.
Suggestion: To improve, specify the expected input format (e.g., list of teams with performance metrics) and the expected output format (e.g., name of the better-performing team). Additionally, consider mentioning any specific formatting requirements if applicable.
--------------------------------------------------

Principle: Examples
Verdict: Weak
Explanation: The prompt lacks example inputs and example outputs to analyze which team performed better. There are no specific scenarios or edge cases provided in the prompt to compare the performance of the teams.
Suggestion: To improve, the prompt should include example inputs such as team statistics, scores, or other performance metrics, along with corresponding example outputs that indicate the better-performing team based on certain criteria. Including specific examples would make the comparison more clear and relevant.
--------------------------------------------------

Principle: Role
Verdict: Weak
Explanation: The prompt does not assign a specific role or persona to the LLM. It lacks a clear definition of the role and does not provide any role-specific instructions or expectations. As a result, the prompt does not guide the LLM's behavior effectively.
Suggestion: Assign a specific role or persona to the LLM, such as a data analyst or team manager. Provide clear instructions or expectations related to the assigned role to guide the LLM's behavior in the task.
--------------------------------------------------

Principle: BestPractices
Verdict: Weak
Explanation: The prompt lacks clear role definitions, constraints, and capabilities. It is also missing details on output formatting and interaction style.
Suggestion: To improve, provide clear role definitions for the teams being compared, set constraints on what criteria determine performance, define capabilities for the analysis, and specify the expected output format and interaction style.
